Many of its ideas are considered fundamental principles of [[Western culture|Western]] [[liberal democracy]].{{sfn|Livesey|2001|p=19}}\r\n\r\nBetween 1700 and 1789, the French population increased from 18&nbsp;million to 26&nbsp;million, leading to large numbers of unemployed, accompanied by sharp increases in [[food prices]] caused by years of bad harvests.{{sfn|Fursenko|McArthur|1976|p=484}} Widespread social distress led to the [[convocation]] of the Estates General in May 1789, the first since 1614. In June, the Estates were converted into a [[National Assembly (French Revolution)|National Assembly]], which passed a series of radical measures, among them the [[Abolition of feudalism in France|abolition of feudalism]], state control of the [[Catholic Church in France|Catholic Church]] and extending the right to vote.\r\n\r\nThe next three years were dominated by the struggle for political control, exacerbated by [[economic depression]] and [[social unrest]]. External powers like [[Habsburg Monarchy|Austria]], [[Kingdom of Great Britain|Britain]] and [[Kingdom of Prussia|Prussia]] viewed the Revolution as a threat, leading to the outbreak of the [[French Revolutionary Wars]] in April 1792. Disillusionment with [[Louis XVI of France|Louis XVI]] led to the establishment of the [[First French Republic]] on 22 September 1792, followed by his [[Execution of Louis XVI|execution]] in January 1793. In June, [[Insurrection of 31 May \u2013 2 June 1793|an uprising in Paris]] replaced the [[Girondins]] who dominated the [[National Legislative Assembly (France)|National Assembly]] with the [[Committee of Public Safety]], headed by [[Maximilien Robespierre]].\r\n\r\nThis sparked the [[Reign of Terror]], an attempt to eradicate alleged \"[[counter-revolutionaries]]\"; by the time it [[Thermidorian Reaction|ended in July 1794]], over 16,600 had been executed in Paris and the provinces. As well as external enemies, the Republic faced a series of internal Royalist and [[Jacobin]] revolts; in order to deal with these, the [[French Directory]] took power in November 1795. Despite military success, the war led to [[economic stagnation]] and internal divisions, and in November 1799 the Directory was replaced by the Consulate.\r\n\r\nMany Revolutionary symbols such as ''[[La Marseillaise]]'' and phrases like ''[[Libert\u00E9, \u00E9galit\u00E9, fraternit\u00E9]]'' reappeared in other revolts, such as the 1917 [[Russian Revolution]].{{sfn|Shlapentokh|1996|pp=61\u201376}} Over the next two centuries, its key principles like equality would inspire campaigns for [[abolitionism|the abolition of slavery]] and [[universal suffrage]].{{sfn|Desan|Hunt|Nelson|2013|pp=3,8,10}} Its values and institutions dominate French politics to this day, and many historians regard the Revolution as one of the most important events in Western history.{{sfn|Feh\u00E9r|1990|pp=117\u2013130}}\r\n\r\n== Causes ==\r\n[[File:Antoine-Fran\u00E7ois Callet - Louis XVI, roi de France et de Navarre (1754-1793), rev\u00EAtu du grand costume royal en 1779 - Google Art Project.jpg|thumb|left|upright=0.8|[[Louis XVI of France|Louis XVI]], who came to the throne in 1774]]\r\n{{Main|Causes of the French Revolution}}\r\n\r\nHistorians generally view the underlying [[causes of the French Revolution]] as the result of the ''[[Ancien R\u00E9gime]]'s'' failure to manage [[Social inequality|social]] and [[economic inequality]]. Rapid population growth and the inability to adequately finance [[government debt]] resulted in economic depression, unemployment and high food prices.{{sfn|Sargent|Velde|1995|pp=474\u2013518}} These combined with a [[regressive tax]] system and resistance to reform by the ruling elite to produce a crisis [[Louis XVI of France|Louis XVI]] proved unable to manage.{{sfn|Baker|1978|pp=279\u2013303}}{{sfn|Jordan|2004|pp=11\u201312}}\r\n\r\nFrom the late 17th century on, political and cultural debate became part of wider European society, rather than being confined to a small [[elite]]. This took different forms, such as the English '[[English coffeehouses in the 17th and 18th centuries|coffeehouse culture]]', and extended to areas colonised by Europeans, particularly [[British North America]]. Contacts between diverse groups in [[Edinburgh]], [[Geneva]], [[Boston]], [[Amsterdam]], [[Paris]], [[London]] or [[Vienna]] were much greater than often appreciated.{{sfn|Jourdan|2007|pp=184-185}}\r\n\r\nTransnational elites who shared ideas and styles were not new; what changed was their extent and the numbers involved.{{sfn|Jourdan|2007|p=187}} Under [[Louis XIV of France|Louis XIV]], the Court at [[Palace of Versailles|Versailles]] was the centre of culture, fashion and political power. Improvements in education and literacy over the course of the 18th century meant larger audiences for newspapers and journals, with [[Masonic lodges]], coffee houses and reading clubs providing areas where people could debate and discuss ideas. The emergence of this so-called \"[[public sphere]]\" led to Paris replacing Versailles as the cultural and intellectual centre, leaving the Court isolated and less able to influence opinion.{{sfn|Blanning|1997|p=26}}\r\n\r\nIn addition to these social changes, the French population grew from 18&nbsp;million in 1700 to 26&nbsp;million in 1789, making it the most populous state in Europe; Paris had over 600,000 inhabitants, of whom roughly one third were either unemployed or had no regular work.{{sfn|Garrioch|1994|p=524}} Inefficient agricultural methods meant domestic farmers could not support these numbers, while primitive transportation networks made it hard to maintain supplies even when there was sufficient. As a result, food prices rose by 65% between 1770 and 1790, yet real wages increased by only 22%.{{sfn|Hufton|1983|p=304}} Food shortages were particularly damaging for the regime, since many blamed price increases on government failure to prevent profiteering.{{sfn|Tilly|1983|p=333}} By the spring of 1789, a poor harvest followed by a severe winter had created a rural [[Peasant|peasantry]] with nothing to sell, and an urban [[proletariat]] whose purchasing power had collapsed.{{sfn|Tilly|1983|p=337}}\r\n\r\n[[File:Europe 1783-1792 en.png|thumb|right|upright=1.0|By 1789, France was the [[Demographics of France|most populous]] country in Europe.]]\r\n\r\nThe other major drag on the economy was state debt. Traditional views of the French Revolution often attribute the financial crisis to the costs of the [[Anglo-French War (1778\u20131783)|1778\u20131783 Anglo-French War]], but modern economic studies show this is only a partial explanation. In 1788, the ratio of debt to [[gross national income]] in France was 55.6%, compared to 181.8% in Britain, and although French borrowing costs were higher, the percentage of revenue devoted to interest payments was roughly the same in both countries.{{sfn|Weir|1989|p=98}} One historian concludes \"neither the level of French state debt in 1788, or its previous history, can be considered an explanation for the outbreak of revolution in 1789\".{{sfn|Weir|1989|p=101}}\r\n\r\nThe problem was French taxes were predominantly paid by the urban and rural poor, while attempts to share the burden more equally were blocked by the regional ''[[parlement]]s'' which controlled financial policy.{{sfn|Doyle|2002|pp=45\u201349}} The resulting impasse in the face of widespread economic distress led to the calling of the [[Estates General of 1789|Estates-General]], which became radicalised by the struggle for control of public finances.{{sfn|Weir|1989|p=96}}\r\n\r\nAlthough not indifferent to the crisis, when faced with opposition Louis XVI tended to back down.{{sfn|Doyle|2002|p=48}} The court became the target of popular anger, especially Queen [[Marie-Antoinette]], who was viewed as a spendthrift [[Habsburg Monarchy|Austrian]] spy, and blamed for the dismissal of 'progressive' ministers like [[Jacques Necker]]. For their opponents, [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]] ideas on equality and democracy provided an intellectual framework for dealing with these issues, while the [[American Revolution]] was seen as confirmation of their practical application.{{sfn|Doyle|2002|pp=73\u201374}}\r\n\r\n== Crisis of the ''Ancien R\u00E9gime'' ==\r\n=== Financial crisis ===\r\n[[File:Parliaments and Sovereign Councils of the Kingdom of France in 1789 (fr).png|left|thumb|upright=1.0|The regional ''Parlements'' in 1789; note area covered by the [[Parlement de Paris]]]]\r\n\r\nThe French state faced a series of budgetary crises during the 18th century, caused primarily by structural deficiencies rather than lack of resources. Unlike Britain, where [[Parliament of Great Britain|Parliament]] determined both expenditures and taxes, in France, the Crown controlled spending, but not revenue.{{sfn|White|1995|p=229}} National taxes could only be approved by the [[Estates General (France)|Estates-General]], which had not sat since 1614; its revenue functions had been assumed by regional ''[[parlement]]s'', the most powerful being the ''[[Parlement de Paris]]' (see Map).{{sfn|Schama|1989|pp=109-112}}\r\n\r\nAlthough willing to authorise one-time taxes, these bodies were reluctant to pass long-term measures, while collection was outsourced to [[Ferme g\u00E9n\u00E9rale#The Ferme g\u00E9n\u00E9rale (1726\u201390)|private individuals]]. This significantly reduced the yield from those that were approved and as a result, France struggled to service its debt despite being larger and wealthier than Britain.{{sfn|White|1995|p=229}} Following partial [[Default (finance)|default]] in 1770, reforms were instituted by [[Anne Robert Jacques Turgot, Baron de Laune|Turgot]], the [[Controller-General of Finances|Finance Minister]], which by 1776 had balanced the budget and reduced government borrowing costs from 12% per year to under 6%. Despite this success, he was dismissed in May 1776 after arguing France could not afford intervention in North America.{{sfn|White|1995|p=230}}\r\n\r\nHe was succeeded by Swiss Protestant [[Jacques Necker]], who was replaced in 1781 by [[Charles Alexandre de Calonne|Charles de Calonne]].{{sfn|Hibbert|1982|p=35}} The war was financed by state debt, creating a large ''[[Rentier capitalism|rentier]]'' class who lived on the interest, primarily members of the French nobility or commercial classes. By 1785 the government was struggling to cover these payments and since default would ruin much of French society, this meant increasing taxes. When the ''parlements'' refused to comply, Calonne persuaded Louis to summon the [[Assembly of Notables]], an advisory council dominated by the upper nobility. The council refused, arguing this could only be approved by the Estates, and in May 1787 Calonne was replaced by the man responsible, [[\u00C9tienne Charles de Lom\u00E9nie de Brienne|de Brienne]], a former [[archbishop of Toulouse]].{{sfn|Schama|1989|pp=287-292}}  {{efn|In 1781, Louis allegedly refused to appoint him Archbishop of Paris on the grounds 'an Archbishop should at least believe in God'.{{sfn|Bredin|1988|p=42}}}} By 1788, debt owed by the French Crown totalled an unprecedented 4.5 billion [[Livre tournois|livres]], while devaluing the coinage caused runaway inflation.{{sfn|Gershoy|1957|p=16-17, 23}} In an effort to resolve the crisis, Necker was re-appointed Finance Minister in August 1788 but was unable to reach an agreement on how to increase revenue and in May 1789 Louis summoned the [[Estates General of 1789 in France|Estates-General]] for the first time in over a hundred and fifty years.{{sfn|Doyle|1990|p=93}}\r\n\r\n=== Estates-General of 1789 ===\r\n{{main|Estates General of 1789 in France}}\r\n[[File:Troisordres.jpg|thumb|right|upright=0.7|Caricature of the Third Estate carrying the First Estate (clergy) and the Second Estate (nobility) on its back]]\r\n\r\nThe Estates-General was divided into three parts; the [[Estates of the realm#First Estate|First]] for members of the clergy, [[Estates of the realm#Second Estate|Second]] for the nobility, and [[Estates of the realm#Third Estate|Third]] for the \"commons\".{{sfn|Hunt|1984|pp=6-10}} Each sat separately, enabling the First and Second Estates to outvote the Third, despite representing less than 5% of the population, while both were largely exempt from tax.{{sfn|Schama|1989|p=115}}\r\n\r\nIn the 1789 elections, the First Estate returned 303 deputies, representing 100,000 Catholic clergy; nearly 10% of French lands were owned directly by individual bishops and monasteries, in addition to [[tithes]] paid by peasants.{{sfn|Doyle|1990|p=59}} More than two-thirds of the clergy lived on less than 500 livres per year, and were often closer to the urban and rural poor than those elected for the Third Estate, where voting was restricted to male French taxpayers, aged 25 or over.{{sfn|Schama|1989|p=335}} As a result, half of the 610 deputies elected to the Third Estate in 1789 were lawyers or local officials, nearly a third businessmen, while fifty-one were wealthy land owners.{{sfn|Doyle|1990|pp=99-101}}\r\n\r\nThe Second Estate elected 291 deputies, representing about 400,000 men and women, who owned about 25% of the land and collected seigneurial dues and rents from their tenants. Like the clergy, this was not a uniform body, and was divided into the ''[[Nobles of the Sword|noblesse d'\u00E9p\u00E9e]]'', or traditional aristocracy, and the ''[[Nobles of the robe|noblesse de robe]]''. The latter derived rank from judicial or administrative posts and tended to be hard-working professionals, who dominated the regional ''parlements'' and were often intensely socially conservative.{{sfn|Schama|1989|pp=116-117}}\r\n\r\nTo assist delegates, each region completed a list of grievances, known as ''[[Cahiers de dol\u00E9ances]]''.{{sfn|Frey|Frey|2004|pp=4-5}} Although they contained ideas that would have seemed radical only months before, most supported the monarchy, and assumed the Estates-General would agree to financial reforms, rather than fundamental constitutional change.{{sfn|Doyle|2001|p=38}} The lifting of press censorship allowed widespread distribution of political writings, mostly written by liberal members of the aristocracy and upper middle-class.{{sfn|Neely|2008|p=56}} [[Abb\u00E9 Siey\u00E8s]], a political theorist and priest elected to the Third Estate, argued it should take precedence over the other two as it represented 95% of the population.{{sfn|Furet|1995|p=45}}\r\n\r\nThe Estates-General convened in the [[Menus-Plaisirs du Roi]] on 5 May 1789, near the [[Palace of Versailles]] rather than in Paris; the choice of location was interpreted as an attempt to control their debates. As was customary, each Estate assembled in separate rooms, whose furnishings and opening ceremonies deliberately emphasised the superiority of the First and Second Estates. They also insisted on enforcing the rule that only those who owned land could sit as deputies for the Second Estate, and thus excluded the immensely popular [[Honor\u00E9 Gabriel Riqueti, comte de Mirabeau|Comte de Mirabeau]].{{sfn|Schama|1989|p=343}}\r\n\r\n[[File:Estatesgeneral.jpg|thumb|left|upright=1.0|Meeting of the Estates General on 5 May 1789 at Versailles]]\r\n\r\nAs separate assemblies meant the Third Estate could always be outvoted by the other two, Siey\u00E8s sought to combine all three. His method was to require all deputies be approved by the Estates-General as a whole, instead of each Estate verifying its own members. Since this meant the legitimacy of deputies derived from the Estates-General, they would have to continue sitting as one body.{{sfn|Hibbert|1982|p=54}} After an extended stalemate, on 10 June the Third Estate proceeded to verify its own deputies, a process completed on 17 June; two days later, they were joined by over 100 members of the First Estate, and declared themselves the [[National Assembly (French Revolution)|National Assembly]]. The remaining deputies from the other two Estates were invited to join, but the Assembly made it clear they intended to legislate with or without their support.{{sfn|Schama|1989|pp=354-355}}\r\n\r\nIn an attempt to prevent the Assembly from convening, Louis XVI ordered the ''Salle des \u00C9tats'' closed down, claiming it needed to be prepared for a royal speech. On 20 June, the Assembly met in a tennis court outside Versailles and [[Tennis Court Oath|swore]] not to disperse until a new constitution had been agreed. Messages of support poured in from Paris and other cities; by 27 June, they had been joined by the majority of the First Estate, plus forty-seven members of the Second, and Louis backed down.{{sfn|Schama|1989|p=356}}\r\n\r\n== Constitutional monarchy (July 1789 \u2013 September 1792) ==\r\n=== Abolition of the ''Ancien R\u00E9gime'' ===\r\n{{main|Storming of the Bastille}}\r\nEven these limited reforms went too far for Marie Antoinette and Louis' younger brother the [[Charles X of France|Comte d'Artois]]; on their advice, Louis dismissed Necker again as chief minister on 11 July.{{sfn|Schama|1989|pp=357-358}} On 12 July, the Assembly went into a non-stop session after rumours circulated he was planning to use the [[Swiss Guards]] to force it to close. The news brought crowds of protestors into the streets, and soldiers of the elite ''[[Gardes Fran\u00E7aises]]'' regiment refused to disperse them.{{sfn|Schama|1989|pp=380-382}}\r\n\r\nOn the 14th, many of these soldiers joined the mob in attacking the [[Bastille]], a royal fortress with large stores of arms and ammunition. The governor [[Bernard-Ren\u00E9 de Launay|de Launay]] surrendered after several hours of fighting that cost the lives of 83 attackers. Taken to the ''[[H\u00F4tel de Ville, Paris|H\u00F4tel de Ville]]'', he was executed, his head placed on a pike and paraded around the city; the fortress was then torn down in a remarkably short time. Although rumoured to hold many prisoners, the Bastille held only seven: four forgers, two noblemen held for \"immoral behaviour\", and a murder suspect. Nevertheless, as a potent symbol of the ''[[Ancien R\u00E9gime]]'', its destruction was viewed as a triumph and [[Bastille Day]] is still celebrated every year.{{sfn|Schama|1989|pp=404-405}}\r\n\r\n[[File:Prise de la Bastille.jpg|thumb|right|upright=1.0|The [[Storming of the Bastille]] on 14 July 1789; the iconic event of the Revolution, still commemorated each year as [[Bastille Day]]]]\r\n\r\nAlarmed by the prospect of losing control of the capital, Louis appointed [[Gilbert du Motier, Marquis de Lafayette|Lafayette]] commander of the [[Garde Nationale|National Guard]], with [[Jean-Sylvain Bailly]] as head of a new administrative structure known as the [[Paris Commune (French Revolution)|Commune]]. On 17 July, he visited Paris accompanied by 100 deputies, where he was greeted by Bailly and accepted a [[Flag of France|tricolore]] [[cockade]] to loud cheers. However, it was clear power had shifted from his court; he was welcomed as 'Louis XVI, father of the French and king of a free people.'{{sfn|Schama|1989|pp=423-424}}\r\n\r\nThe short-lived unity enforced on the Assembly by a common threat quickly dissipated. Deputies argued over constitutional forms, while civil authority rapidly deteriorated. On 22 July, former Finance Minister [[Joseph Foullon de Dou\u00E9|Joseph Foullon]] and his son were lynched by a Parisian mob, and neither Bailly nor Lafayette could prevent it. In rural areas, wild rumours and paranoia resulted in the formation of militia and an agrarian insurrection known as ''[[Great Fear|la Grande Peur]]''.{{sfn|Hibbert|1982|p=93}} The breakdown of law and order and frequent attacks on aristocratic property led much of the nobility to flee abroad. These ''[[\u00E9migr\u00E9]]s'' funded reactionary forces within France and urged foreign monarchs to back a [[counter-revolution]].{{sfn|Lefebvre|1962|pp=187\u2013188}}\r\n\r\nIn response, the Assembly published the [[August Decrees]] which [[Abolition of feudalism in France|abolished feudalism]] and other privileges held by the nobility, notably exemption from tax. Other decrees included equality before the law, opening public office to all, freedom of worship, and cancellation of special privileges held by provinces and towns.{{sfn|Lefebvre|1962|p=130}} Over 25% of French farmland was subject to [[Manorialism|feudal dues]], which provided most of the income for large landowners; these were now cancelled, along with [[tithe]]s due to the church. The intention was for tenants to pay compensation for these losses but the majority refused to comply and the obligation was cancelled in 1793.{{sfn|Forster|1967|pp=71\u201386}}\r\n\r\nWith the suspension of the 13 regional ''parlements'' in November, the key institutional pillars of the old regime had all been abolished in less than four months. From its early stages, the Revolution therefore displayed signs of its radical nature; what remained unclear was the constitutional mechanism for turning intentions into practical applications.{{sfn|Furet|Ozouf|1989|p=112}}\r\n\r\n=== Creating a new constitution ===\r\nAssisted by [[Thomas Jefferson]], Lafayette prepared a draft constitution known as the [[Declaration of the Rights of Man and of the Citizen]], which echoed some of the provisions of the [[United States Declaration of Independence|Declaration of Independence]]. However France had reached no consensus on the role of the Crown, and until this question was settled, it was impossible to create political institutions. When presented to the legislative committee on 11 July, it was rejected by pragmatists such as [[Jean Joseph Mounier]], President of the Assembly, who feared creating expectations that could not be satisfied.{{sfn|Schama|1989|pp=442-444}}\r\n\r\n[[File:Declaration of Human Rights.jpg|thumb|left|upright=0.8|The [[Declaration of the Rights of Man and of the Citizen]] of 26 August 1789]]\r\n\r\nAfter editing by Mirabeau, it was published on 26 August as a statement of principle.{{sfn|Baker|1995|pp=154-196}} It contained provisions considered radical in any European society, let alone 1789 France, and while historians continue to debate responsibility for its wording, most agree the reality is a mix. Although Jefferson made major contributions to Lafayette's draft, he himself acknowledged an intellectual debt to [[Montesquieu]], and the final version was significantly different.{{sfn|Ludwikowski|1990|pp=452-453}} French historian [[Georges Lefebvre]] argues that combined with the elimination of privilege and [[feudalism]], it \"highlighted equality in a way the (American Declaration of Independence) did not\".{{sfn|Lefebvre|1962|p=146}}\r\n\r\nMore importantly, the two differed in intent; Jefferson saw the [[Constitution of the United States|US Constitution]] and [[United States Bill of Rights|Bill of Rights]] as fixing the political system at a specific point in time, claiming they 'contained no original thought...but expressed the American mind' at that stage.{{sfn|Jefferson|1903|p=May 8, 1825}} The 1791 French Constitution was viewed as a starting point, the Declaration providing an aspirational vision, a key difference between the two Revolutions. Attached as a preamble to the [[French Constitution of 1791]], and that of the 1870 to 1940 [[French Third Republic]], it was incorporated into the current [[Constitution of France]] in 1958.{{sfn|Fremont-Barnes|2007|p=190}}\r\n\r\nDiscussions continued. Mounier, supported by conservatives like [[G\u00E9rard de Lally-Tollendal]], wanted a [[bicameral]] system, with an [[upper house]] appointed by the king, who would have the right of veto. On 10 September, the majority led by Siey\u00E8s and [[Charles Maurice de Talleyrand-P\u00E9rigord|Talleyrand]] rejected this in favour of a single assembly, while Louis retained only a \"[[suspensive veto]]\"; this meant he could delay the implementation of a law, but not block it. On this basis, a new committee was convened to agree on a constitution; the most controversial issue was [[citizenship]], linked to the debate on the balance between individual rights and obligations. Ultimately, the 1791 Constitution distinguished between 'active citizens' who held political rights, defined as French males over the age of 25, who paid direct taxes equal to three days' labour, and 'passive citizens', who were restricted to 'civil rights'. As a result, it was never fully accepted by radicals in the [[Jacobin club]].{{sfn|Ludwikowski|1990|pp=456-457}}\r\n\r\nFood shortages and the worsening economy caused frustration at the lack of progress, and the Parisian working-class, or ''[[sans culottes]]'', became increasingly restive. This came to a head in late September, when the Flanders Regiment arrived in Versailles to take over as the royal bodyguard and in line with normal practice were welcomed with a ceremonial banquet. Popular anger was fuelled by press descriptions of this as a 'gluttonous orgy', and claims the tricolor cockade had been abused. The arrival of these troops was also viewed as an attempt to intimidate the Assembly.{{sfn|Schama|1989|pp=459-460}}\r\n\r\nOn 5 October 1789, crowds of women assembled outside the [[H\u00F4tel de Ville, Paris|H\u00F4tel de Ville]], urging action to reduce prices and improve bread supplies.{{sfn|Doyle|1990|p=121}} These protests quickly turned political, and after seizing weapons stored at the H\u00F4tel de Ville, some 7,000 [[Women's March on Versailles|marched on Versailles]], where they entered the Assembly to present their demands. They were followed by 15,000 members of the National Guard under Lafayette, who tried to dissuade them, but took command when it became clear they would desert if he did not grant their request.{{sfn|Schama|1989|pp=460-463}}\r\n\r\nWhen the National Guard arrived later that evening, Lafayette persuaded Louis the safety of his family required relocation to Paris. Next morning, some of the protestors broke into the Royal apartments, searching for Marie Antoinette, who escaped. They ransacked the palace, killing several guards. Although the situation remained tense, order was eventually restored, and the Royal family and Assembly left for Paris, escorted by the National Guard.{{sfn|Doyle|1990|p=122}} Announcing his acceptance of the August Decrees and the Declaration, Louis committed to [[constitutional monarchy]], and his official title changed from 'King of France' to 'King of the French'.{{sfn|Schama|1989|p=470}}\r\n\r\n=== Revolution and the church ===\r\n\r\nHistorian [[John McManners]] argues \"in eighteenth-century France, throne and altar were commonly spoken of as in close alliance; their simultaneous collapse ... would one day provide the final proof of their interdependence.\" One suggestion is that after a century of persecution, some [[Huguenots|French Protestants]] actively supported an anti-Catholic regime, a resentment fuelled by Enlightenment thinkers such as [[Voltaire]].{{sfn|Censer|Hunt|2001|p=16}} Philosopher [[Jean-Jacques Rousseau]] wrote it was \"manifestly contrary to the law of nature... that a handful of people should gorge themselves with superfluities while the hungry multitude goes in want of necessities.\"{{sfn|Hunt|Martin|Rosenwein|2003|p=625}}\r\n\r\n[[File:Decret de l'Assembl\u00E9e National qui supprime les Ordres Religieux et Religieuses.jpg|thumb|right|upright=1.0|In this caricature, monks and nuns enjoy their new freedom after the decree of 16 February 1790.]]\r\n\r\nThe Revolution caused a massive shift of power from the Catholic Church to the state; although the extent of religious belief has been questioned, elimination of tolerance for religious minorities meant by 1789 being French also meant being Catholic.{{sfn|Betros|2010|pp=16\u201321}} The church was the largest individual landowner in France, controlling nearly 10% of all estates and levied [[tithe]]s, effectively a 10% tax on income, collected from peasant farmers in the form of crops. In return, it provided a minimal level of social support.{{sfn|Censer|Hunt|2001|p=4}}\r\n\r\nThe August decrees abolished tithes, and on 2 November the Assembly confiscated all church property, the value of which was used to back a new paper currency known as ''[[assignats]]''. In return, the state assumed responsibilities such as paying the clergy and caring for the poor, the sick and the orphaned.{{sfn|McManners|1969|p=27}} On 13 February 1790, religious orders and [[monasteries]] were dissolved, while [[monk]]s and [[nun]]s were encouraged to return to private life.{{sfn|Censer|Hunt|2001|p=92}}\r\n\r\nThe [[Civil Constitution of the Clergy]] of 12 July 1790 made them employees of the state, as well as establishing rates of pay and a system for electing priests and bishops. [[Pope Pius VI]] and many French Catholics objected to this since it denied the authority of the [[Pope]] over the French Church. In October, thirty [[Bishop (Catholic Church)|bishops]] wrote a declaration denouncing the law, further fuelling opposition.{{sfn|Shusterman|2013|pp=58-87}}\r\n\r\nWhen clergy were required to swear loyalty to the Civil Constitution in November 1790, it split the church between the 24% who complied, and the majority who refused.{{sfn|Kennedy|1989|p=151}} This stiffened popular resistance against state interference, especially in traditionally Catholic areas such as [[Normandy]], [[Brittany (administrative region)|Brittany]] and the [[Vend\u00E9e]], where only a few priests took the oath and the civilian population turned against the revolution.{{sfn|Shusterman|2013|pp=58-87}} The result was state-led persecution of \"[[Refractory clergy]]\", many of whom were forced into exile, deported, or executed.{{sfn|Censer|Hunt|2001|p=61}}\r\n\r\n===Political divisions===\r\nThe period from October 1789 to spring 1791 is usually seen as one of relative tranquility, when some of the most important legislative reforms were enacted. While certainly true, many provincial areas experienced conflict over the source of legitimate authority, where officers of the ''Ancien R\u00E9gime'' had been swept away, but new structures were not yet in place. This was less obvious in Paris, since the formation of the National Guard made it the best policed city in Europe, but growing disorder in the provinces inevitably affected members of the Assembly.{{sfn|Scott|1975|pp=861-863}}\r\n\r\n[[File:Federation.jpg|thumb|left|upright=1.0|The ''[[F\u00EAte de la F\u00E9d\u00E9ration]]'' on 14 July 1790 celebrated the establishment of the constitutional monarchy.]]\r\n\r\nCentrists led by Siey\u00E8s, Lafayette, Mirabeau and Bailly created a majority by forging consensus with ''monarchiens'' like Mounier, and independents including [[Adrien Duport]], [[Antoine Pierre Joseph Marie Barnave|Barnave]] and [[Alexandre Lameth]]. At one end of the political spectrum, reactionaries like [[Jacques Antoine Marie de Cazal\u00E8s|Cazal\u00E8s]] and [[Jean-Sifrein Maury|Maury]] denounced the Revolution in all its forms, with extremists like [[Maximilien Robespierre]] at the other. He and [[Jean-Paul Marat]] gained increasing support for opposing the criteria for 'active citizens', which had disenfranchised much of the Parisian proletariat. In January 1790, the National Guard tried to arrest Marat for denouncing Lafayette and Bailly as 'enemies of the people'.{{sfn|Schama|1989|pp=498-499}}\r\n\r\nOn 14 July 1790, celebrations were held throughout France commemorating the fall of the Bastille, with participants swearing an oath of fidelity to 'the nation, the law and the king.' The ''[[F\u00EAte de la F\u00E9d\u00E9ration]]'' in Paris was attended by Louis XVI and his family, with [[Charles Maurice de Talleyrand-P\u00E9rigord|Talleyrand]] performing a [[mass (liturgy)|mass]]. Despite this show of unity, the Assembly was increasingly divided, while external players like the Paris Commune and National Guard competed for power. One of the most significant was the [[Jacobin]] club; originally a forum for general debate, by August 1790 it had over 150 members, split into different factions.{{sfn|Schama|1989|pp=527-529}}\r\n\r\nThe Assembly continued to develop new institutions; in September 1790, the regional ''Parlements'' were abolished and their legal functions replaced by a new independent judiciary, with [[jury trial]]s for criminal cases. However, moderate deputies were uneasy at popular demands for universal suffrage, labour unions and cheap bread, and over the winter of 1790 and 1791, they passed a series of measures intended to disarm popular radicalism. These included exclusion of poorer citizens from the National Guard, limits on use of petitions and posters, and the June 1791 [[Le Chapelier Law 1791|Le Chapelier Law]] suppressing trade guilds and any form of worker organisation.{{sfn|Tackett|2003|p=478}}\r\n\r\nThe traditional force for preserving law and order was the army, which was increasingly divided between officers, who largely came from the nobility, and ordinary soldiers. In August 1790, the loyalist General [[Fran\u00E7ois Claude Amour, marquis de Bouill\u00E9|Bouill\u00E9]] suppressed a serious mutiny at [[Nancy, France|Nancy]]; although congratulated by the Assembly, he was criticised by Jacobin radicals for the severity of his actions. Growing disorder meant many professional officers either left or became \u00E9migr\u00E9s, further destabilising the institution.{{sfn|Doyle|2009|pp=334\u2013336}}\r\n\r\n===Varennes and after===\r\n{{main|Flight to Varennes}}\r\nHeld in the [[Tuileries Palace]] under virtual house arrest, Louis XVI was urged by his brother and wife to re-assert his independence by taking refuge with Bouill\u00E9, who was based at [[Montm\u00E9dy]] with 10,000 soldiers considered loyal to the Crown.{{sfn|Price|2003|p=170}} The royal family left the palace in disguise on the night of 20 June 1791; late the next day, Louis was recognised as he passed through [[Varennes]], arrested and taken back to Paris. The attempted escape had a profound impact on public opinion; since it was clear Louis had been seeking refuge in Austria, the Assembly now demanded oaths of loyalty to the regime, and began preparing for war, while fear of 'spies and traitors' became pervasive.{{sfn|Tackett|2003|p=473}}\r\n\r\n[[File:Retour Varennes 1791.jpg|thumb|right|upright=1.3|After the [[Flight to Varennes]]; the Royal family are escorted back to Paris]]\r\n\r\nDespite calls to replace the monarchy with a republic, Louis retained his position but was generally regarded with acute suspicion and forced to swear allegiance to the constitution. A new decree stated retracting this oath, making war upon the nation, or permitting anyone to do so in his name would be considered abdication. However, radicals led by [[Jacques Pierre Brissot]] prepared a petition demanding his deposition, and on 17 July, an immense crowd gathered in the [[Champ de Mars]] to sign. Led by Lafayette, the National Guard was ordered to \"preserve public order\" and responded to a barrage of stones by [[Champ de Mars massacre|firing into the crowd]], killing between 13 and 50 people.{{sfn|Tackett|2004|pp=148-150}}\r\n\r\nThe massacre badly damaged Lafayette's reputation; the authorities responded by closing radical clubs and newspapers, while their leaders went into exile or hiding, including Marat. {{sfn|Conner|2012|pp=83-85}} On 27 August, [[Leopold II, Holy Roman Emperor|Emperor Leopold II]] and [[Frederick William II of Prussia]] issued the [[Declaration of Pillnitz]] declaring their support for Louis, and hinting at an invasion of France on his behalf. In reality, Leopold and Frederick had met to discuss the [[Partitions of Poland]], and the Declaration was primarily made to satisfy Comte d'Artois and other \u00E9migr\u00E9s. Nevertheless, the threat rallied popular support behind the regime.{{sfn|Soboul|1975|pp=226\u2013227}}\r\n\r\nBased on a motion proposed by Robespierre, existing deputies were barred from [[1791 French legislative election|elections]] held in early September for the [[French Legislative Assembly]]. Although Robespierre himself was one of those excluded, his support in the clubs gave him a political power base not available to Lafayette and Bailly, who resigned respectively as head of the National Guard and the Paris Commune. The new laws were gathered together in the [[French Constitution of 1791|1791 Constitution]], and submitted to Louis XVI, who pledged to defend it \"from enemies at home and abroad\". On 30 September, the Constituent Assembly was dissolved, and the Legislative Assembly convened the next day.{{sfn|Lefebvre|1962|p=212}}\r\n\r\n===Fall of the monarchy===\r\n\r\nThe Legislative Assembly is often dismissed by historians as an ineffective body, compromised by divisions over the role of the monarchy which were exacerbated by Louis' resistance to limitations on his powers and attempts to reverse them using external support.{{sfn|Lyons|1975|p=5}} Restricting the franchise to those who paid a minimum amount of tax meant only 4 out of 6&nbsp;million Frenchmen over 25 were able to vote; it largely excluded the ''sans culottes'' or urban working class, who  increasingly saw the new regime as failing to meet their demands for bread and work.{{sfn|Mitchell|1984|pp=356-360}}\r\n\r\nThis meant the new constitution was opposed by significant elements inside and outside the Assembly, itself split into three main groups. 245 members were affiliated with Barnave's ''[[Feuillant (political group)|Feuillants]]'', constitutional monarchists who considered the Revolution had gone far enough, while another 136 were Jacobin leftists who supported a republic, led by Brissot and usually referred to as ''Brissotins''.{{sfn|Schama|1989|p=582}} The remaining 345 belonged to ''[[The Plain|La Plaine]]'', a central faction who switched votes depending on the issue; many of whom shared ''Brissotins''  suspicions as to Louis' commitment to the Revolution.{{sfn|Schama|1989|p=582}} After Louis officially accepted the new Constitution, one response was recorded as being \"''Vive le roi, s'il est de bon foi!''\", or \"Long live the king \u2013 if he keeps his word\".{{sfn|Thompson|1932|p=77}}\r\n\r\nAlthough a minority, the ''Brissotins'' control of key committees allowed them to focus on two issues, both intended to portray Louis as hostile to the Revolution by provoking him into using his veto. The first concerned \u00E9migr\u00E9s; between October and November, the Assembly approved measures confiscating their property and threatening them with the death penalty.{{sfn|Schama|1989|pp=586-587}} The second was non-juring priests, whose opposition to the Civil Constitution led to a state of near civil war in southern France, which Bernave tried to defuse by relaxing the more punitive provisions. On 29 November, the Assembly passed a decree giving refractory clergy eight days to comply, or face charges of 'conspiracy against the nation', which even Robespierre viewed as too far, too soon. As expected, Louis vetoed both.{{sfn|Schama|1989|pp=585-586}}\r\n\r\n[[File:Jacques Bertaux - Prise du palais des Tuileries - 1793.jpg|thumb|upright=1.0|left|The storming of the Tuileries Palace, 10 August 1792]]\r\n\r\nAccompanying this was a campaign for war against Austria and Prussia, also led by Brissot, whose aims have been interpreted as a mixture of cynical calculation and revolutionary idealism. While exploiting popular anti-Austrianism, it reflected a genuine belief in exporting the values of political liberty and popular sovereignty.{{sfn|Lalev\u00E9e|2019|pp=67-70}} Ironically, Marie Antoinette headed a faction within the court that also favoured war, seeing it as a way to win control of the military, and restore royal authority. In December 1791, Louis made a speech in the Assembly giving foreign powers a month to disband the \u00E9migr\u00E9s or face war, which was greeted with enthusiasm by supporters and suspicion from opponents.{{sfn|Schama|1989|p=586}}\r\n\r\nBernave's inability to build a consensus in the Assembly resulted in the appointment of a new government, chiefly composed of ''Brissotins''. On 20 April 1792 the [[French Revolutionary Wars]] began when France armies attacked Austrian and Prussian forces along their borders, before suffering a series of [[Louis XVI and the Legislative Assembly#The initial disasters of war|disastrous defeats]]. In an effort to mobilise popular support, the government ordered non-juring priests to swear the oath or be deported, dissolved the [[Constitutional Guard]] and replaced it with 20,000 ''f\u00E9d\u00E9r\u00E9s''; Louis agreed to disband the Guard, but vetoed the other two proposals, while Lafayette called on the Assembly to suppress the clubs.{{sfn|Shusterman|2013|pp=88-117}}\r\n\r\nPopular anger increased when details of the [[Brunswick Manifesto]] reached Paris on 1 August, threatening 'unforgettable vengeance' should any oppose the Allies in seeking to restore the power of the monarchy. [[Insurrection of 10 August 1792|On the morning of 10 August]], a combined force of Parisian National Guard and provincial f\u00E9d\u00E9r\u00E9s attacked the Tuileries Palace, killing many of the [[Swiss Guards|Swiss Guard]] protecting it.{{sfn|Dwyer|2008|pp=99-100}} Louis and his family took refuge with the Assembly and shortly after 11:00 am, the deputies present voted to 'temporarily relieve the king', effectively suspending the monarchy.{{sfn|McPhee|2012|pp=164\u2013166}}\r\n\r\n== First Republic (1792\u20131795) ==\r\n=== Proclamation of the First Republic ===\r\n{{main|National Convention}}\r\n[[File:Execution of Louis XVI.jpg|thumb|right|upright=1.0|[[Execution of Louis XVI]] in the [[Place de la Concorde]], facing the empty pedestal where the statue of his grandfather, [[Louis XV]] previously stood]]\r\n\r\nIn late August, [[1792 French National Convention election|elections]] were held for the [[National Convention]]; voter restrictions meant those cast fell to 3.3&nbsp;million, versus 4&nbsp;million in 1791, while intimidation was widespread.{{sfn|Crook|1996 |p=94}} The former ''Brissotins'' now split into moderate ''[[Girondins]]'' led by Brissot, and radical ''[[Montagnard (French Revolution)|Montagnards]]'', headed by [[Maximilien Robespierre]], [[Georges Danton]] and [[Jean-Paul Marat]]. While loyalties constantly shifted, around 160 of the 749 deputies were Girondists, 200 Montagnards and 389 members of ''La Plaine''. Led by [[Bertrand Bar\u00E8re]], [[Pierre Joseph Cambon]] and [[Lazare Carnot]], as before this central faction acted as a [[swing vote]].{{sfn|Shusterman|2013|pp=223-269}}\r\n\r\nIn the [[September Massacres]], between 1,100 to 1,600 prisoners held in Parisian jails were [[extrajudicial killings|summarily executed]], the vast majority of whom were common criminals.{{sfn|Lewis|2002|p=38}} A response to the capture of [[Longwy]] and [[Verdun]] by Prussia, the perpetrators were largely National Guard members and ''[[f\u00E9d\u00E9r\u00E9s]]'' on their way to the front. Responsibility is disputed, but even moderates expressed sympathy for the action, which soon spread to the provinces; the killings reflected widespread concern over social disorder {{sfn|Tackett|2011|pp=54-55}}\r\n\r\nOn 20 September, the French army won a stunning victory over the Prussians at [[Battle of Valmy|Valmy]]. Emboldened by this, on 22 September the Convention replaced the monarchy with the [[French First Republic]] and introduced a new [[French Republican Calendar|calendar]], with 1792 becoming \"Year One\".{{sfn|Bakker|2008|p=49}} The next few months were taken up with the trial of ''Citoyen Louis Capet'', formerly Louis XVI. While the Convention was evenly divided on the question of his guilt, members were increasingly influenced by radicals centred in the Jacobin clubs and Paris Commune. The [[Brunswick Manifesto]] made it easy to portray Louis as a threat to the Revolution, apparently confirmed when extracts from his [[Armoire de fer|personal correspondence]] were published showed him conspiring with Royalist exiles serving in the Prussian and Austrian armies.{{sfn|Barton|1967|pp=146-160}}\r\n\r\nOn 17 January 1793, the Assembly condemned Louis to death for \"conspiracy against public liberty and general safety\", by 361 to 288; another 72 members voted to execute him subject to a variety of delaying conditions. The sentence was carried out on 21 January on the ''Place de la R\u00E9volution'', now the [[Place de la Concorde]].{{sfn|Doyle|1990|p=196}} Horrified conservatives across Europe called for the destruction of revolutionary France; in February the Convention anticipated this by declaring war on [[Kingdom of Great Britain|Britain]] and the [[Dutch Republic]]; these countries were later joined by [[Enlightenment Spain|Spain]], [[Portuguese Empire|Portugal]], [[Kingdom of Naples|Naples]] and the [[Grand Duchy of Tuscany|Tuscany]] in the [[War of the First Coalition]].{{sfn|Wasson|2009|p=118}}\r\n\r\n=== Political crisis and fall of the Girondins ===\r\n\r\nThe Girondins hoped war would unite the people behind the government and provide an excuse for rising prices and food shortages, but found themselves the target of popular anger. Many left for the provinces. The first conscription measure or ''[[lev\u00E9e en masse]]'' on 24 February sparked riots in Paris and other regional centres. Already unsettled by changes imposed on the church, in March the traditionally conservative and royalist [[Vend\u00E9e]] rose in revolt. On 18th, [[Charles Fran\u00E7ois Dumouriez|Dumouriez]] was defeated at [[Battle of Neerwinden (1793)|Neerwinden]] and defected to the Austrians. Uprisings followed in [[Bordeaux]], [[Lyon]], [[Toulon]], [[Marseilles]] and [[Caen]]. The Republic seemed on the verge of collapse.{{sfn|Shusterman|2013|pp=143-173}}\r\n\r\nThe crisis led to the creation on 6 April 1793 of the [[Committee of Public Safety]], an executive committee accountable to the convention.{{sfn|Shusterman|2013|pp=271-312}} The Girondins made a fatal political error by indicting Marat before the [[Revolutionary Tribunal]] for allegedly directing the September massacres; he was quickly acquitted, further isolating the Girondins from the ''sans-culottes''. When [[Jacques H\u00E9bert]] called for a popular revolt against the \"henchmen of Louis Capet\" on 24 May, he was arrested by the [[Commission of Twelve]], a Girondin-dominated tribunal set up to expose 'plots'. In response to protests by the Commune, the Commission warned \"if by your incessant rebellions something befalls the representatives of the nation,...Paris will be obliterated\".{{sfn|Shusterman|2013|pp=143-173}}\r\n\r\n[[File:Jacques-Louis David - La Mort de Marat.jpg|thumb|left|upright=0.8|''[[The Death of Marat]]'' by [[Jacques-Louis David]] (1793)]]\r\n\r\nGrowing discontent allowed the clubs to mobilise against the Girondins. Backed by the Commune and elements of the National Guard, on 31 May they attempted to seize power in a [[Insurrection of 31 May-2 June 1793|coup]]. Although the coup failed, on 2 June the convention was surrounded by a crowd of up to 80,000, demanding cheap bread, unemployment pay and political reforms, including restriction of the vote to the ''sans-culottes'', and the right to remove deputies at will.{{sfn|Schama|1989|p=724}} Ten members of the commission and another twenty-nine members of the Girondin faction were arrested, and on 10 June, the Montagnards took over the Committee of Public Safety.{{sfn|Schama|1989|pp=725-726}}\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, a committee led by Robespierre's close ally [[Louis Antoine de Saint-Just|Saint-Just]] was tasked with preparing a new [[French Constitution of 1793|Constitution]]. Completed in only eight days, it was ratified by the convention on 24 June, and contained radical reforms, including [[universal male suffrage]] and abolition of slavery in French colonies. However, normal legal processes were suspended following the assassination of Marat on 13 July by the Girondist [[Charlotte Corday]], which the Committee of Public Safety used as an excuse to take control. The 1793 Constitution itself was suspended indefinitely in October.{{sfn|Kennedy|2000|p=53}}\r\n\r\nKey areas of focus for the new government included creating a new state ideology, economic regulation and winning the war.{{sfn|Schama|1989|p=756}} The urgent task of suppressing internal dissent was helped by divisions among their opponents; while areas like the Vend\u00E9e and [[Brittany]] wanted to restore the monarchy, most supported the Republic but opposed the regime in Paris. On 17 August, the Convention voted a second ''lev\u00E9e en masse''; despite initial problems in equipping and supplying such large numbers, by mid-October Republican forces had re-taken Lyon, Marseilles and Bordeaux, while defeating Coalition armies at [[Battle of Hondschoote|Hondschoote]] and [[Battle of Wattignies|Wattignies]].{{sfn|Schama|1989|p=766}}\r\n\r\n=== Reign of Terror ===\r\n{{Main|Reign of Terror}}\r\n[[File:Octobre 1793, supplice de 9 \u00E9migr\u00E9s.jpg|thumb|Nine ''[[French emigration (1789\u20131815)|\u00E9migr\u00E9s]]'' are executed by [[guillotine]], 1793]]\r\nThe [[Reign of Terror]] began as a way to harness revolutionary fervour, but quickly degenerated into the settlement of personal grievances. At the end of July, the Convention set [[General maximum|price controls]] over a wide range of goods, with the death penalty for hoarders, and on 9 September 'revolutionary groups' were established to enforce them. On 17th, the [[Law of Suspects]] ordered the arrest of suspected \"enemies of freedom\", initiating what became known as the \"Terror\". According to archival records, from September 1793 to July 1794 some 16,600 people were executed on charges of counter-revolutionary activity; another 40,000 may have been summarily executed or died awaiting trial.{{sfn|Gough|1998|p=77}}\r\n\r\nFixed prices, death for 'hoarders' or 'profiteers', and confiscation of grain stocks by groups of armed workers meant that by early September Paris was suffering acute food shortages. However, France's biggest challenge was servicing the huge public debt inherited from the former regime, which continued to expand due to the war. Initially the debt was financed by sales of confiscated property, but this was hugely inefficient; since few would buy assets that might be repossessed, fiscal stability could only be achieved by continuing the war until French counter-revolutionaries had been defeated. As internal and external threats to the Republic increased, the position worsened; dealing with this by printing ''[[assignats]]'' led to inflation and higher prices.{{sfn|White|1995|p=242}}\r\n\r\nOn 10 October, the Convention recognised the Committee of Public Safety as the supreme [[National Convention#Revolutionary government|Revolutionary Government]], and suspended the Constitution until peace was achieved.{{sfn|Kennedy|2000|p=53}} In mid-October, Marie Antoinette was found guilty of a long list of crimes and guillotined; two weeks later, the Girondist leaders arrested in June were also executed, along with [[Louis Philippe II, Duke of Orl\u00E9ans|Philippe \u00C9galit\u00E9]].

Another defeat at [[Battle of Le Mans (1793)|Le Mans]] on 23 December ended the rebellion as a major threat, although the insurgency continued until 1796. The extent of the brutal repression that followed has been debated by French historians since the mid-19th century.{{sfn|Cough|1987|pp=977-988}} Between November 1793 to February 1794, over 4,000 were [[Drownings at Nantes|drowned in the Loire at Nantes]] under the supervision of [[Jean-Baptiste Carrier]]. Historian Reynald Secher claims that as many as 117,000 died between 1793 and 1796.

Relaxation of [[price controls]] and rampant inflation caused increasing unrest among the ''sans-culottes'', but the [[Flanders Campaign#The French counter-offensive|improved military situation]] reduced fears the Republic was in danger. Many feared their own survival depended on Robespierre's removal; during a meeting on 29 June, three members of the Committee of Public Safety called him a dictator in his face.{{sfn|Schama|1989|p=838}}\r\n\r\n[[File:Execution robespierre, saint just....jpg|thumb|right|upright=1.15|The execution of Robespierre on 28 July 1794 marked the end of the [[Reign of Terror]].]]\r\n\r\nRobespierre responded by not attending sessions, allowing his opponents to build a coalition against him.

When he refused to give names, the session broke up in confusion. That evening he made the same speech at the Jacobins club, where it was greeted with huge applause and demands for execution of the 'traitors'. It was clear if his opponents did not act, he would; in the Convention next day, [[9 Thermidor (Fall of Robespierre)|Robespierre and his allies]] were shouted down. His voice failed when he tried to speak, a deputy crying \"The blood of Danton chokes him!\"{{sfn|Schama|1989|p=844}}\r\n\r\nThe Convention authorised [[Maximilien Robespierre#Arrest|his arrest]]; he and his supporters took refuge in the Hotel de Ville, defended by the National Guard. That evening, units loyal to the Convention stormed the building, and Robespierre was arrested after a failed suicide attempt. He was executed on 28 July with 19 colleagues, including Saint-Just and [[Georges Couthon]], followed by 83 members of the Commune.{{sfn|Schama|1989|p=845}} The Law of 22 Prairial was repealed, any surviving Girondists reinstated as deputies, and the Jacobin Club was closed and banned.{{sfn|Soboul|1975|pp=425\u2013428}}\r\n\r\nThere are various interpretations of the Terror and the violence with which it was conducted; Marxist historian [[Albert Soboul]] saw it as essential to defend the Revolution from external and internal threats. [[Fran\u00E7ois Furet]] argues the intense ideological commitment of the revolutionaries and their utopian goals required the extermination of any opposition.{{sfn|Furet|1989|p=222}} A middle position suggests violence was not inevitable but the product of a series of complex internal events, exacerbated by war.{{sfn|Hanson|2009|p=?}}\r\n\r\n=== Thermidorean reaction ===\r\nThe bloodshed did not end with the death of Robespierre; [[Southern France]] saw a wave of [[First White Terror|revenge killings]], directed against alleged Jacobins, Republican officials and Protestants. Although the victors of Thermidor asserted control over the Commune by executing their leaders, some of the leading \"terrorists\"{{citation needed|date=November 2020}} retained their positions. They included [[Paul Barras]], later chief executive of the [[French Directory]], and [[Joseph Fouch\u00E9]], director of the killings in Lyon who served as [[Minister of Police (France)|Minister of Police]] under the Directory, the Consulate and [[First French Empire|Empire]]. Others were exiled or prosecuted, a process that took several months.{{sfn|Andress|2006|p=237}}\r\n\r\n[[File:Paul Barras directeur.jpg|left|thumb|upright=0.8|Former Viscount and Montagnard [[Paul Barras]], who took part in the Thermidorean reaction and later headed the [[French Directory]]]]\r\n\r\nThe December 1794 [[Treaty of La Jaunaye]] ended the [[Chouannerie]] in western France by allowing freedom of worship and the return of non-juring priests.{{sfn|Andress|2006|p=354}} This was accompanied by military success; in January 1795, French forces helped the Dutch [[Patriottentijd|Patriots]] set up the [[Batavian Republic]], securing their northern border.{{sfn|Schama|1977|pp=178\u2013192}} The war with Prussia was concluded in favour of France by the [[Peace of Basel]] in April 1795, while Spain made peace shortly thereafter.{{sfn|Hargreaves-Mawdsley|1968|pp=175-176}}\r\n\r\nHowever, the Republic still faced a crisis at home. Food shortages arising from a poor 1794 harvest were exacerbated in Northern France by the need to supply the army in [[Flanders]], while the winter was the worst since 1709.{{sfn|Lyons|1975|p=15}} By April 1795, people were starving and the ''assignat'' was worth only 8% of its face value; in desperation, the Parisian poor [[Insurrection of 12 Germinal, Year III|rose again]].{{sfn|Woronoff|1984|p=10}} They were quickly dispersed and the main impact was another round of arrests, while Jacobin prisoners in Lyon were summarily executed.{{sfn|Woronoff|1984|p=15}}\r\n\r\nA committee drafted a new [[Constitution of the Year III|constitution]], approved by [[plebiscite]] on 23 September 1795 and put into place on 27th.{{sfn|Doyle|1989|p=320}} Largely designed by [[Pierre Claude Fran\u00E7ois Daunou|Pierre Daunou]] and [[Fran\u00E7ois Antoine de Boissy d'Anglas|Boissy d'Anglas]], it established a [[bicameral legislature]], intended to slow down the legislative process, ending the wild swings of policy under the previous unicameral systems. The [[Council of 500]] was responsible for drafting legislation, which was reviewed and approved by the [[Council of Ancients]], an upper house containing 250 men over the age of 40. Executive power was in the hands of five Directors, selected by the Council of Ancients from a list provided by the lower house, with a five-year mandate.{{sfn|Lyons|1975|pp=18-19}}\r\n\r\nDeputies were chosen by indirect election, a total franchise of around 5&nbsp;million voting in primaries for 30,000 electors, or 0.6% of the population. Since they were also subject to stringent property qualification, it guaranteed the return of conservative or moderate deputies. In addition, rather than dissolving the previous legislature as in 1791 and 1792, the so-called 'law of two-thirds' ruled only 150 new deputies would be elected each year. The remaining 600 ''Conventionnels'' kept their seats, a move intended to ensure stability.{{sfn|Lyons|1975|p=19}}\r\n\r\n== Directory (1795\u20131799) ==\r\n{{main|French Directory}}\r\n[[File:Attaque de la Convention nationale, 1790.jpg|thumb|right|upright=1.0|Troops under [[Napoleon]] fire on Royalist insurgents in Paris, [[13 Vend\u00E9miaire|5 October 1795]]]]\r\n\r\nThe Directory has a poor reputation amongst historians; for Jacobin sympathisers, it represented the betrayal of the Revolution, while Bonapartists emphasised its corruption to portray Napoleon in a better light.{{sfn|Lyons|1975|p=2}} Although these criticisms were certainly valid, it also faced internal unrest, a stagnating economy and an expensive war, while hampered by the impracticality of the constitution. Since the Council of 500 controlled legislation and finance, they could paralyse government at will, and as the Directors had no power to call new elections, the only way to break a deadlock was to rule by decree or use force. As a result, the Directory was characterised by \"chronic violence, ambivalent forms of justice, and repeated recourse to heavy-handed repression.\"{{sfn|Brown|2006|p=1}}\r\n\r\nRetention of the ''Conventionnels'' ensured the [[Thermidorians]] held a majority in the legislature and three of the five Directors, but they faced an increasing challenge from the right. On 5 October, Convention troops led by [[Napoleon]] put down a [[13 Vend\u00E9miaire|royalist rising]] in Paris; when the first [[1795 French Directory election|elections]] were held two weeks later, over 100 of the 150 new deputies were royalists of some sort.{{sfn|Lyons|1975|pp=19-20}} The power of the Parisian ''san culottes'' had been broken by the suppression of the May 1795 revolt; relieved of pressure from below, the Jacobins became natural supporters of the Directory against those seeking to restore the monarchy.{{sfn|Lyons|1975|pp=27-28}}\r\n\r\nRemoval of price controls and a collapse in the value of the ''assignat'' led to inflation and soaring food prices. By April 1796, over 500,000 Parisians were reportedly in need of relief, resulting in the May insurrection known as the [[Conspiracy of the Equals]]. Led by the revolutionary [[Fran\u00E7ois-No\u00EBl Babeuf]], their demands included the implementation of the 1793 Constitution and a more equitable distribution of wealth. Despite limited support from sections of the military, it was easily crushed, with Babeuf and other leaders executed.{{sfn|Lyons|1975|pp=32-33}} Nevertheless, by 1799 the economy had been stabilised and important reforms made allowing steady expansion of French industry; many remained in place for much of the 19th century.{{sfn|Lyons|1975|p=175}}\r\n\r\nPrior to 1797, three of the five Directors were firmly Republican; Barras, [[Louis Marie de La R\u00E9velli\u00E8re-L\u00E9peaux|R\u00E9velli\u00E8re-L\u00E9peaux]] and [[Jean-Fran\u00E7ois Rewbell]], as were around 40% of the legislature. The same percentage were broadly [[Club de Clichy|centrist]] or unaffiliated, along with two Directors, [[\u00C9tienne-Fran\u00E7ois Letourneur]] and [[Lazare Carnot]]. Although only 20% were committed Royalists, many centrists supported the restoration of the exiled [[Louis XVIII of France|Louis XVIII]] in the belief this would end the [[War of the First Coalition]] with Britain and Austria.{{sfn|McLynn|1997|p=151}} The elections of May 1797 resulted in significant gains for the right, with Royalists [[Jean-Charles Pichegru]] elected President of the Council of 500, and [[Fran\u00E7ois-Marie, marquis de Barth\u00E9lemy|Barth\u00E9lemy]] appointed a Director.{{sfn|McLynn|1997|p=150}}\r\n\r\n[[File:Bouchot - Le general Bonaparte au Conseil des Cinq-Cents.jpg|thumb|left|upright=0.8|[[Napol\u00E9on Bonaparte]] in the Council of 500 during [[18 Brumaire]], 9 November 1799]]\r\n\r\nWith Royalists apparently on the verge of power, the Republicans staged a [[Coup of 18 Fructidor|coup on 4 September]]. Using troops from Bonaparte's [[Army of Italy (France)|Army of Italy]] under [[Pierre Augereau]], the Council of 500 was forced to approve the arrest of Barth\u00E9lemy, Pichegru and Carnot. The election results were cancelled, sixty-three leading royalists deported to [[French Guiana]] and new laws passed against \u00E9migr\u00E9s, Royalists and ultra-Jacobins. Although the power of the monarchists had been destroyed, it opened the way for direct conflict between Barras and his opponents on the left.{{sfn|McLynn|1997|p=155}}\r\n\r\nDespite general war weariness, fighting continued and the [[1798 French Directory election|1798 elections]] saw a resurgence in Jacobin strength. The [[French campaign in Egypt and Syria|invasion of Egypt]] in July 1798 confirmed European fears of French expansionism, and the [[War of the Second Coalition]] began in November. Without a majority in the legislature, the Directors relied on the army to enforcing decrees and extract revenue from conquered territories. This made generals like Bonaparte and [[Barth\u00E9lemy Catherine Joubert|Joubert]] essential political players, while both the army and the Directory became notorious for their corruption.{{sfn|McLynn|1997|p=208}}\r\n\r\nIt has been suggested the Directory did not collapse for economic or military reasons, but because by 1799, many 'preferred the uncertainties of authoritarian rule to the continuing ambiguities of parliamentary politics'.{{sfn|Hunt|Lansky|Hanson|1979|p=735-736}} The architect of its end was Siey\u00E8s, who when asked what he had done during the Terror allegedly answered \"I survived\". Nominated to the Directory, his first action was removing Barras, using a coalition that included Talleyrand and former Jacobin [[Lucien Bonaparte]], Napoleon's brother and president of the Council of 500.{{sfn|McLynn|1997|p=211}} On 9 November 1799, the [[Coup of 18 Brumaire]] replaced the five Directors with the [[French Consulate]], which consisted of three members, Bonaparte, Siey\u00E8s, and [[Roger Ducos]]; most historians consider this the end point of the French Revolution.{{sfn|McLynn|1997|p=219}}\r\n\r\n== French Revolutionary Wars ==\r\n[[File:Valmy Battle painting.jpg|thumb|right|upright=1.0|French victory at the [[Battle of Valmy]] on 20 September 1792 validated the Revolutionary idea of armies composed of citizens]]\r\n\r\nThe Revolution initiated a series of conflicts that began in 1792 and ended only with Napoleon's defeat at [[Battle of Waterloo|Waterloo]] in 1815. In its early stages, this seemed unlikely; the 1791 Constitution specifically disavowed \"war for the purpose of conquest\", and although traditional tensions between France and Austria re-emerged in the 1780s, [[Joseph II, Holy Roman Emperor|Emperor Joseph]] cautiously welcomed the reforms. Austria was [[Austro-Turkish War (1788\u20131791)|at war with the Ottomans]], as were [[Russo-Turkish War (1787\u20131792)|the Russians]], while both were negotiating with Prussia over [[Partitions of Poland|partitioning Poland]]. Most importantly, Britain preferred peace, and as Emperor [[Leopold II, Holy Roman Emperor|Leopold]] stated after the Declaration of Pillnitz, \"without England, there is no case\".{{sfn|Rothenberg|1988|pp=779-780}}\r\n\r\nIn late 1791, factions within the Assembly came to see war as a way to unite the country and secure the Revolution by eliminating hostile forces on its borders and establishing its \"natural frontiers\".{{sfn|Hayworth|2015|p=89}} France declared war on Austria in April 1792 and issued the first [[lev\u00E9e en masse|conscription]] orders, with recruits serving for twelve months. By the time peace finally came in 1815, the conflict had involved every major European power as well as the United States, redrawn the map of Europe and expanded into the [[Americas]], the [[Middle East]] and [[Indian Ocean]].{{sfn|Rothenberg|1988|p=772}}\r\n\r\nFrom 1701 to 1801, the population of Europe grew from 118 to 187&nbsp;million; combined with new mass production techniques, this allowed belligerents to support large armies, requiring the mobilisation of national resources. It was a different kind of war, fought by nations rather than kings, intended to destroy their opponents' ability to resist, but also to implement deep-ranging social change. While all wars are political to some degree, this period was remarkable for the emphasis placed on reshaping boundaries and the creation of entirely new European states.{{sfn|Rothenberg|1988|pp=772-773}}\r\n\r\nIn April 1792, French armies invaded the [[Austrian Netherlands]] but suffered a series of setbacks before victory over an Austrian-Prussian army at Valmy in September. After defeating a second Austrian army at [[Battle of Jemappes|Jemappes]] on 6 November, they occupied the Netherlands, areas of the [[Rhineland]], [[County of Nice|Nice]] and [[County of Savoy|Savoy]]. Emboldened by this success, in February 1793 France declared war on the [[Dutch Republic]], Spain and Britain, beginning the [[War of the First Coalition]].{{sfn|Rothenberg|1988|p=785}} However, the expiration of the 12-month term for the 1792 recruits forced the French to relinquish their conquests. In August, new conscription measures were passed and by May 1794 the French army had between 750,000 and 800,000 men.{{sfn|Blanning|1996|pp=120-121}} Despite high rates of desertion, this was large enough to manage multiple internal and external threats; for comparison, the combined Prussian-Austrian army was less than 90,000.{{sfn|Brown|1995|p=35}}\r\n\r\n[[File:La Bataille du Pont d'Arcole.jpg|thumb|left|upright=1.0|Napoleon's [[Italian campaigns of the French Revolutionary Wars#Bonaparte's war|Italian campaigns]] reshaped the map of Italy]]\r\n\r\nBy February 1795, France had annexed the Austrian Netherlands, established their frontier on the left bank of the Rhine and replaced the Dutch Republic with the [[Batavian Republic]], a satellite state. These victories led to the collapse of the anti-French coalition; Prussia made peace in April 1795, followed soon after by Spain, leaving Britain and Austria as the only major powers still in the war.{{sfn|Hayworth|2015|p=256}} In October 1797, a series of defeats by Bonaparte in Italy led Austria to agree to the [[Treaty of Campo Formio]], in which they formally ceded the Netherlands and recognised the [[Cisalpine Republic]].{{sfn|McLynn|1997|p=157}}\r\n\r\nFighting continued for two reasons; first, French state finances had come to rely on indemnities levied on their defeated opponents. Second, armies were primarily loyal to their generals, for whom the wealth achieved by victory and the status it conferred became objectives in themselves. Leading soldiers like Hoche, Pichegru and Carnot wielded significant political influence and often set policy; [[Campo Formio]] was approved by Bonaparte, not the Directory, which strongly objected to terms it considered too lenient.{{sfn|McLynn|1997|p=157}}\r\n\r\nDespite these concerns, the Directory never developed a realistic peace programme, fearing the destabilising effects of peace and the consequent demobilisation of hundreds of thousands of young men. As long as the generals and their armies stayed away from Paris, they were happy to allow them to continue fighting, a key factor behind sanctioning Bonaparte's [[French campaign in Egypt and Syria|invasion of Egypt]]. This resulted in aggressive and opportunistic policies, leading to the War of the Second Coalition in November 1798.{{sfn|Rothenberg|1988|p=787}}\r\n\r\n==French colonial policy==\r\n[[File:Fire in Saint-Domingo 1791, German copper engraving.jpg|thumb|right|upright=1.0|The [[Haitian Revolution|Saint-Domingue]] slave revolt in 1791]]\r\n\r\nAlthough the French Revolution had a dramatic impact in numerous areas of Europe,<ref>{{cite web |title=The National Archives - Homepage |url=https:\/\/www.nationalarchives.gov.uk\/education\/resources\/french-revolution\/ |website=The National Archives |access-date=25 January 2021}}<\/ref> the French colonies felt a particular influence.

Deprived of political rights under the ''Ancien Regime'', the 1791 Constitution classed them as \"passive\" citizens, leading to demands for social and political equality for women and an end to male domination. They expressed these demands using pamphlets and clubs such as the ''[[Society of the Friends of Truth|Cercle Social]]'', whose largely male members viewed themselves as contemporary feminists.{{sfn|Hunt|1996|p=123}} However, in October 1793, the Assembly banned all women's clubs and the movement was crushed; this was driven by the emphasis on masculinity in a wartime situation, antagonism towards feminine \"interference\" in state affairs due to Marie Antoinette, and traditional male supremacy.{{sfn|Devance|1977|pp=341\u2013376}} A decade later the [[Napoleonic Code]] confirmed and perpetuated women's second-class status.{{sfn|Abray|1975|pp=43\u201362}}\r\n\r\nAt the beginning of the Revolution, women took advantage of events to force their way into the political sphere, swore oaths of loyalty, \"solemn declarations of patriotic allegiance, [and] affirmations of the political responsibilities of citizenship.\" Activists included Girondists like [[Olympe de Gouges]], author of the [[Declaration of the Rights of Woman and of the Female Citizen]], and [[Charlotte Corday]], the killer of Marat. Others like [[Th\u00E9roigne de M\u00E9ricourt]], [[Pauline L\u00E9on]] and the [[Society of Revolutionary Republican Women]] supported the Jacobins, staged demonstrations in the National Assembly and took part in the October 1789 March to Versailles.

They also demanded vigorous price controls to keep bread \u2013 the major food of the poor people \u2013 from becoming too expensive. After the Convention passed the law in September 1793, the Revolutionary Republican Women demanded vigorous enforcement, but were countered by market women, former servants, and religious women who adamantly opposed price controls (which would drive them out of business) and resented attacks on the aristocracy and on religion. Fist fights broke out in the streets between the two factions of women.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, the men who controlled the Jacobins rejected the Revolutionary Republican Women as dangerous rabble-rousers. At this point the Jacobins controlled the government; they dissolved the Society of Revolutionary Republican Women, and decreed that all women's clubs and associations were illegal. They sternly reminded women to stay home and tend to their families by leaving public affairs to the men. Organised women were permanently shut out of the French Revolution after 30 October 1793.{{sfn|Levy|Applewhite |Johnson|1979|pp=143\u2013149}}\r\n\r\n=== Prominent women ===\r\n[[Olympe de Gouges]] wrote a number of plays, short stories, and novels. Her publications emphasised that women and men are different, but this shouldn't prevent equality under the law. In her [[Declaration of the Rights of Woman and of the Female Citizen]] she insisted that women deserved rights, especially in areas concerning them directly, such as divorce and recognition of illegitimate children.<ref name=\"De Gouges Writings 564\u2013568\">De Gouges \"Writings\" 564\u201368<\/ref>\r\n\r\n[[Madame Roland]] (a.k.a. Manon or Marie Roland) was another important female activist. Her political focus was not specifically on women or their liberation. She focused on other aspects of the government, but was a feminist by virtue of the fact that she was a woman working to influence the world. Her personal letters to leaders of the Revolution influenced policy; in addition, she often hosted political gatherings of the Brissotins, a political group which allowed women to join. As she was led to the scaffold, Madame Roland shouted \"O liberty! What crimes are committed in thy name!\"{{sfn|Dalton|2001|pp=262\u2013267}} Many activists were punished for their actions, while some were executed for \"conspiring against the unity and the indivisibility of the Republic\".{{sfn|Beckstrand|2009|p=20}}\r\n\r\n=== Counter-revolutionary women ===\r\nCounter-revolutionary women resisted what they saw as the increasing intrusion of the state into their lives.{{sfn|Hufton|1992|p=104}} One major consequence was the [[Dechristianization of France during the French Revolution|dechristianisation]] of France, a movement strongly rejected by many devout people; especially for women living in rural areas, the closing of the churches meant a loss of normality.{{sfn|Hufton|1992|pp=106\u2013107}} This sparked a counter-revolutionary movement led by women; while supporting other political and social changes, they opposed the dissolution of the Catholic Church and revolutionary cults like the [[Cult of the Supreme Being]].{{sfn|Desan|Hunt|Nelson|2013|p=452}} [[Olwen Hufton]] argues some wanted to protect the Church from heretical changes enforced by revolutionaries, viewing themselves as \"defenders of faith\".{{sfn|Hufton|1998|p=303}}\r\n\r\nEconomically, many peasant women refused to sell their goods for [[assignats]] because this form of currency was unstable and was backed by the sale of confiscated Church property. By far the most important issue to counter-revolutionary women was the passage and the enforcement of the [[Civil Constitution of the Clergy]] in 1790. In response to this measure, women in many areas began circulating anti-oath pamphlets and refused to attend masses held by priests who had sworn oaths of loyalty to the Republic. These women continued to adhere to traditional practices such as Christian burials and naming their children after saints in spite of revolutionary decrees to the contrary.{{sfn|Hufton|1998|pp=303\u2013304}}\r\n\r\n== Economic policies ==\r\n[[File:France-500Livres-1790-uni.jpg|thumb|upright=1.0| Early ''Assignat'' of 29 September 1790: 500 [[French livres|livres]]]]\r\n\r\nThe Revolution abolished many economic constraints imposed by the ''Ancien r\u00E9gime'', including church tithes and feudal dues although tenants often paid higher rents and taxes.{{sfn|Sutherland|2002|pp=1\u201324}} All church lands were nationalised, along with those owned by Royalist exiles, which were used to back paper currency known as [[assignats]], and the feudal [[guild]] system eliminated.{{sfn|Vardi|1988|pp=704\u2013717}} It also abolished the highly inefficient system of [[Ferme g\u00E9n\u00E9rale|tax farming]], whereby private individuals would collect taxes for a hefty fee. The government seized the foundations that had been set up (starting in the 13th century) to provide an annual stream of revenue for hospitals, poor relief, and education. The state sold the lands but typically local authorities did not replace the funding and so most of the nation's charitable and [[History of education in France#Revolution|school systems were massively disrupted]]{{sfn|Palmer|1986|pp=181\u2013197}}\r\n\r\nBetween 1790 to 1796, industrial and agricultural output dropped, foreign trade plunged, and prices soared, forcing the government to finance expenditure by issuing ever increasing quantities ''assignats''. When this resulted in escalating inflation, the response was to impose price controls and persecute private speculators and traders, creating a [[Black market]]. Between 1789 to 1793, the annual deficit increased from 10% to 64% of gross national product, while annual inflation reached 3,500% after a poor harvest in 1794 and the removal of price controls. The assignats were withdrawn in 1796 but inflation continued until the introduction of the gold-based ''Franc germinal'' in 1803.{{sfn|Brezis|Crouzet|1995|pp=7\u201340}}\r\n\r\n== Long-term impact ==\r\n{{main|Influence of the French Revolution}}\r\n\r\nThe French Revolution had a major impact on European and Western history, by ending feudalism and creating the path for future advances in broadly defined individual freedoms.{{sfn|Frey|Frey| 2004|p=?}}{{sfn|Palmer|Colton|1995|p=341}}{{sfn|Feh\u00E9r|1990|pp=117\u2013130}} Its impact on [[French nationalism]] was profound, while also stimulating nationalist movements throughout Europe.{{sfn|Dann|Dinwiddy|1988|p=13}} Its influence was great in the hundreds of small German states and elsewhere, where it{{clarify|reason=refers to \"its influence\" but intended meaning was probably \"events in that place\"|date=November 2020}} was either inspired by the French example or in reaction against it.{{sfn|Keitner|2007|p=12}}\r\n\r\n=== France ===\r\nThe impact of the Revolution on French society was enormous and led to numerous changes, some of which were widely accepted, while others continue to be debated.{{sfn|Stewart|1951|pp=783\u201394}} Under Louis XIV, political power was centralised at Versailles and controlled by the monarch, whose power derived from immense personal wealth, control over the army and appointment of clergy, provincial governors, lawyers and judges.{{sfn|Thompson|1952|p=22}} In less than a year, the king was reduced to a figurehead, the nobility deprived of titles and estates and the church of its monasteries and property. Clergy, judges and magistrates were controlled by the state, and the army sidelined, with military power placed held by the revolutionary National Guard. The central elements of 1789 were the slogan \"Liberty, Equality and Fraternity\" and \"[[The Declaration of the Rights of Man and the Citizen]]\", which Lefebvre calls \"the incarnation of the Revolution as a whole.\"{{sfn|Lefebvre|1947|p=212}}\r\n\r\nThe long-term impact on France was profound, shaping politics, society, religion and ideas, and polarising politics for more than a century. Historian [[Fran\u00E7ois Victor Alphonse Aulard|Fran\u00E7ois Aulard]] writes:\r\n\r\n<blockquote>\"From the social point of view, the Revolution consisted in the suppression of what was called the feudal system, in the emancipation of the individual, in greater division of landed property, the abolition of the privileges of noble birth, the establishment of equality, the simplification of life.... The French Revolution differed from other revolutions in being not merely national, for it aimed at benefiting all humanity.\"<ref>Aulard in Arthur Tilley, ed.

By 1799, much of its property and institutions had been confiscated and its senior leaders dead or in exile. Its cultural influence was also under attack, with efforts made to remove such as Sundays, holy days, saints, prayers, rituals and ceremonies. Ultimately these attempts not only failed but aroused a furious reaction among the pious; opposition to these changes was a key factor behind the revolt in the Vend\u00E9e.{{sfn|Kennedy|1989|pp=338\u2013353}}\r\n\r\n[[File:Le Bataillon Carr\u00E9, Affaire de Foug\u00E8res 1793 (Square Battalion).jpg|thumb|upright=1.0|left|The 1793 [[War in the Vend\u00E9e]] was in part sparked by opposition to state persecution of the Catholic church]]\r\n\r\nOver the centuries, charitable foundations had been set up to fund hospitals, poor relief, and schools; when these were confiscated and sold off, the funding was not replaced, causing massive disruption to these support systems.{{sfn|Sutherland|2002|pp=1-24}} Under the ''Ancien r\u00E9gime'', medical assistance for the rural poor was often provided by nuns, acting as nurses but also physicians, surgeons, and apothecaries; the Revolution abolished most of these orders without replacing organised nursing support.{{sfn|McHugh|2012|pp=428\u2013456}} Demand remained strong and after 1800 nuns resumed their work in hospitals and on rural estates. They were tolerated by officials because they had widespread support and were a link between elite male physicians and distrustful peasants who needed help.{{sfn|L\u00E9onard|1977|pp=887\u2013907}}\r\n\r\nThe church was a primary target during the Terror, due to its association with \"counter-revolutionary\" elements, resulting in the persecution of priests and destruction of churches and religious images throughout France. An effort was made to replace the Catholic Church altogether with the [[Cult of Reason]], and with civic festivals replacing religious ones, leading to attacks by locals on state officials. These policies were promoted by the atheist H\u00E9bert and opposed by the deist Robespierre, who denounced the campaign and replaced the Cult of Reason with the [[Cult of the Supreme Being]].{{sfn|Censer|Hunt|2001|pp=92\u201394}}\r\n\r\nThe [[Concordat of 1801]] established the rules for a relationship between the Catholic Church and French State that lasted until it was abrogated by the [[French Third Republic]] on 11 December 1905. The Concordat was a compromise that restored some of the Church's traditional roles but not its power, lands or monasteries; the clergy became public officials controlled by Paris, not Rome, while Protestants and Jews gained equal rights.{{sfn|Ellis|1997|pp=235-255}} However, debate continues into the present over the role of religion in the public sphere and related issues such as church-controlled schools. Recent arguments over the use of Muslim religious symbols in schools, such as wearing headscarves, have been explicitly linked to the conflict over Catholic rituals and symbols during the Revolution.{{sfn| Soper|Fetzer|2003|pp=39\u201359}}\r\n\r\n==== Economics ====\r\nTwo thirds of France was employed in agriculture, which was transformed by the Revolution. With the breakup of large estates controlled by the Church and the nobility and worked by hired hands, rural France became more a land of small independent farms. Harvest taxes were ended, such as the tithe and seigneurial dues, much to the relief of the peasants. [[Primogeniture]] was ended both for nobles and peasants, thereby weakening the family patriarch. Because all the children had a share in the family's property, there was a declining birth rate.<ref>{{cite book |author=P.M.

Napoleon as emperor set up a constitutional system (although he remained in full control), and the restored Bourbons were forced to go along with one. After the abdication of Napoleon III in 1871, the monarchists probably had a voting majority, but they were so factionalised they could not agree on who should be king, and instead the [[French Third Republic]] was launched with a deep commitment to upholding the ideals of the Revolution.<ref>Furet, ed., ''A Critical Dictionary of the French Revolution,'' pp. 479\u201393<\/ref><ref>Robert Tombs, \"Inventing politics: from Bourbon Restoration to republican monarchy,\" in Martin S.

In 1793, as war broke out in Europe, the [[Democratic-Republican Party]] led by former [[United States Ambassador to France|American minister to France]] [[Thomas Jefferson]] favored revolutionary France and pointed to the 1778 treaty that was still in effect. [[George Washington]] and his unanimous cabinet, including Jefferson, decided that the treaty did not bind the United States to enter the war. Washington [[Proclamation of Neutrality|proclaimed neutrality]] instead.<ref>Susan Dunn, ''Sister Revolutions: French Lightning, American Light'' (2000)<\/ref> Under President [[John Adams]], a [[Federalist Party|Federalist]], an undeclared naval war took place with France from 1798 until 1799, often called the \"[[Quasi War]]\". Jefferson became president in 1801, but was hostile to Napoleon as a dictator and emperor. However, the two entered negotiations over the [[Louisiana Territory]] and agreed to the [[Louisiana Purchase]] in 1803, an acquisition that substantially increased the size of the United States.\r\n\r\n== Historiography ==\r\n{{main|Historiography of the French Revolution}}\r\n\r\nThe French Revolution has received enormous amounts of historical attention, both from the general public and from scholars and academics. The views of historians, in particular, have been characterised as falling along ideological lines, with disagreement over the significance and the major developments of the Revolution.<ref>Rude pp. 12\u201314<\/ref> [[Alexis de Tocqueville]] argued that the Revolution was a manifestation of a more prosperous middle class becoming conscious of its social importance.<ref>Rude, p. 15<\/ref>\r\n\r\nOther thinkers, like the conservative [[Edmund Burke]], maintained that the Revolution was the product of a few conspiratorial individuals who brainwashed the masses into subverting the old order, a claim rooted in the belief that the revolutionaries had no legitimate complaints.<ref>Rude, p. 12<\/ref> Other historians, influenced by [[Marxism|Marxist]] thinking, have emphasised the importance of the peasants and the urban workers in presenting the Revolution as a gigantic [[class struggle]].<ref>Rude, p. 17<\/ref> In general, scholarship on the French Revolution initially studied the political ideas and developments of the era, but it has gradually shifted towards [[social history]] that analyses the impact of the Revolution on individual lives.<ref>Rude, pp. 12\u201320<\/ref>\r\n\r\nHistorians until the late 20th century emphasised class conflicts from a largely Marxist perspective as the fundamental driving cause of the Revolution.<ref>Soboul, Albert. ''La R\u00E9volution fran\u00E7aise'', pp. 45\u201348<\/ref> The central theme of this argument was that the Revolution emerged from the rising bourgeoisie, with support from the [[sans-culottes]], who fought to destroy the aristocracy.<ref>{{cite book |author=George C. Comninel |title=Rethinking the French Revolution: Marxism and the Revisionist Challenge |url=https:\/\/books.google.com\/books?id=z9HR3ALvUXoC&pg=PA31 |year=1987 |publisher=Verso |page=31 |isbn=978-0-86091-890-5}}<\/ref> However, Western scholars largely abandoned Marxist interpretations in the 1990s. By the year 2000 many historians were saying that the field of the French Revolution was in intellectual disarray. The old model or paradigm focusing on class conflict has been discredited, and no new explanatory model had gained widespread support.<ref name=\"Rebecca L.

After the collapse of the [[First French Empire|First Empire]] in 1815, the French public lost the rights and privileges earned since the Revolution, but they remembered the participatory politics that characterised the period, with one historian commenting: \"Thousands of men and even many women gained firsthand experience in the political arena: they talked, read, and listened in new ways; they voted; they joined new organisations; and they marched for their political goals. Revolution became a tradition, and [[republicanism]] an enduring option.\"{{sfn|Hanson|2009|p=189}}\r\n\r\nSome historians argue that the French people underwent a fundamental transformation in self-identity, evidenced by the elimination of privileges and their replacement by [[Human rights|rights]] as well as the growing decline in social deference that highlighted the principle of equality throughout the Revolution.<ref>Hanson, p. 191<\/ref> The Revolution represented the most significant and dramatic challenge to political absolutism up to that point in history and spread democratic ideals throughout Europe and ultimately the world.<ref name=\"RiemerSimon1997\">{{cite book |last1=Riemer |first1=Neal |last2=Simon |first2=Douglas |title=The New World of Politics: An Introduction to Political Science |url=https:\/\/books.google.com\/books?id=gKa3FTpH49oC&pg=PA106 |year=1997 |publisher=Rowman & Littlefield |isbn=978-0-939693-41-2 |page=106}}<\/ref> Throughout the 19th century, the revolution was heavily analysed by economists and political scientists, who saw the [[Social class|class]] nature of the revolution as a fundamental aspect in understanding human social evolution itself.
