A number of individuals settled in the neighboring countries (chiefly Great Britain, Germany and Austria), while some settled in Russia, and quite a few also went to the United States.  The displacement of these Frenchmen led to a spread of French culture, policies regulating immigration, and a safe haven for [[Royalist (France)|Royalists]] and other counterrevolutionaries to outlast the violence of the French Revolution.

In addition to effects similar to those in Italy and Switzerland, France saw the introduction of the principle of legal equality, and the downgrading of the once powerful and rich Catholic Church to just a bureau controlled by the government. Power became centralized in Paris, with its strong bureaucracy and an army supplied by conscripting all young men. French politics were permanently polarized\u2014'left' and 'right'  were the new terms for the supporters and opponents of the principles of the Revolution.\r\n\r\n==Impact on France==\r\n{{Main|French Revolution#France}}\r\nThe changes in France were enormous; some were widely accepted and others were bitterly contested into the late 20th century.<ref>John Hall Stewart, ''A Documentary Survey of the french revolution'' (1951) pp 783\u201394<\/ref>  Before the Revolution, the people had little power or voice. The kings had so thoroughly centralized the system that most nobles spent their time at Versailles, and played only a small direct role in their home districts. Thompson says that the kings had:\r\n:ruled by virtue of their personal wealth, their patronage of the nobility, their disposal of ecclesiastical offices, their provincial governors (''intendants''), their control over the judges and magistrates, and their command of the Army.<ref>J.M. Thompson, ''Robespierre and the French Revolution'' (1962), p. 22<\/ref>\r\n\r\nAfter the first year of revolution, this power had been stripped away. The king was a figurehead, the nobility had lost all their titles and most of their land, the Church lost its monasteries and farmlands, bishops, judges and magistrates were elected by the people, the army was almost helpless, with military power in the hands of the new revolutionary National Guard. The central elements of 1789 were the slogan \"''[[Libert\u00E9, \u00E9galit\u00E9, fraternit\u00E9]]''\" and the [[Declaration of the Rights of Man and of the Citizen]], which Lefebvre calls \"the incarnation of the Revolution as a whole.\"<ref>{{cite book|author=Georges Lefebvre|title=The Coming of the French Revolution|url=https:\/\/books.google.com\/books?id=P4EYuia7buUC&pg=PA212|orig-year=1947|year=2005|publisher=Princeton UP|page=212|isbn=0691121885}}<\/ref>\r\n\r\nThe long-term impact on France was profound, shaping politics, society, religion and ideas, and polarizing politics for more than a century.

Napoleon was finally defeated and reactionaries took over France.  Even so there were many deep results in terms of political ideas and institutions.<ref>Annie Jourdan,  \"Napoleon and Europe: the legacy of the French Revolution.\" in ''The Routledge Companion to the French Revolution in World History'' (Routledge, 2015) pp. 221-238.<\/ref>\r\n\r\n===French emigration===\r\n{{Main|French emigration (1789\u20131815)}}To escape political tensions and save their lives, a number of individuals, mostly men, emigrated from France. Many settled in neighboring countries (chiefly Great Britain, Germany, Austria, and Prussia), and quite a few went to the United States.  The presence of these thousands of Frenchmen of varying socioeconomic backgrounds who had just fled a hotbed of revolutionary activity posed a problem for the nations that extended refuge to the migrants.  The fear was that they brought with them a plot to disrupt the political order, which did lead to increased regulation and documentation of the influx of immigrants in neighboring countries.  Still, most nations such as Britain remained magnanimous and welcomed the French.\r\n\r\n===French conquests===\r\nIn foreign affairs, the French Army at first was quite successful.  It conquered the [[Austrian Netherlands]] (approximately modern-day Belgium) and turned it into another province of France.  It conquered the [[Dutch Republic]] (the present Netherlands), and made it a puppet state. It took control of the German areas on the left bank of the Rhine River and set up a puppet regime. It conquered Switzerland and most of Italy, setting up a series of puppet states.  The result was glory for France, and an infusion of much needed money from the conquered lands, which also provided direct support to the French Army. However the enemies of France, led by Britain and funded by the British Treasury, formed a Second Coalition in 1799 (with Britain joined by Russia, the Ottoman Empire, and Austria).  It scored a series of victories that rolled back French successes, and the French Army became trapped in Egypt. Napoleon himself slipped through the British blockade in October 1799, returning to Paris.<ref>William Doyle, ''The Oxford History of the French Revolution'' (1989), pp 341\u201368.<\/ref>\r\n\r\nNapoleon conquered most of Italy in the name of the French Revolution in 1797\u201399. He consolidated old units and split up Austria's holdings. He set up a series of new republics, complete with new codes of law and abolition of old feudal privileges. Napoleon's [[Cisalpine Republic]] was centered on Milan. Genoa the city became a republic while its hinterland became the [[Ligurian Republic]]. The [[Roman Republic (18th century)|Roman Republic]] was formed out of the papal holdings while the pope himself was sent to France. The [[Neapolitan Republic (1799)|Neapolitan Republic]] was formed around Naples, but it lasted only five months before the enemy forces of the Coalition recaptured it.<ref>Steven T. Ross, ''European Diplomatic History, 1789\u20131815: France Against Europe'' (1969)<\/ref>\r\n\r\nIn 1805 he formed the [[Kingdom of Italy (Napoleonic)|Kingdom of Italy]], with himself as king and his stepson as viceroy. In addition, France turned the Netherlands into the [[Batavian Republic]], and Switzerland into the [[Helvetic Republic]]. All these new countries were satellites of France and had to pay large subsidies to Paris, as well as provide military support for Napoleon's wars. Their political and administrative systems were modernized, the metric system introduced, and trade barriers reduced. Jewish ghettos were abolished. Belgium and Piedmont became integral parts of France.<ref>Alexander Grab, ''Napoleon and the Transformation of Europe'' (2003) pp 62\u201365, 78\u201379, 88\u201396, 115\u201317, 154\u201359<\/ref><ref>Palmer, ''The Age of the Democratic Revolution'' 2:293\u2013326, 365\u201394<\/ref><br>The new nations were abolished and returned to prewar owners in 1814.

The majority of the British establishment were strongly opposed to the revolution. Britain, guided by [[Pitt the Younger]], led and funded the series of coalitions that fought France from 1793 to 1815, and with the deposition of [[Napoleon Bonaparte]] culminated with the (temporary) restoration of the Bourbons. [[Edmund Burke]] wrote ''[[Reflections on the Revolution in France]]'', a pamphlet notable for its defence of the principle of constitutional monarchy; the events surrounding the [[London Corresponding Society]] were an example of the fevered times.<ref>Emma Vincent Macleod, ''A War of Ideas: British Attitudes to the War against Revolutionary France, 1792\u20131802'' (1999)<\/ref><ref>Palmer, ''The Age of the Democratic Revolution: The Struggle, Volume II'' (1970), pp 459\u2013505.<!--publisher, pages, ISSN\/ISBN needed--><\/ref>\r\n\r\n===Ireland===\r\nIn Ireland, the effect was to transform what had been an attempt by the [[Protestant Ascendancy]] to gain some autonomy into a mass movement led by the [[Society of United Irishmen]] consisting of both Catholics and Protestants.

At first it brought liberal and democratic ideas, the end of guilds, of serfdom and of the Jewish ghetto. It brought economic freedoms and agrarian and legal reform. German intellectuals celebrated the outbreak, hoping to see the triumph of Reason and  The Enlightenment.  There were enemies as well, as the royal courts in Vienna and Berlin denounced the overthrow of the king and the threatened spread of notions of liberty, equality, and fraternity.\r\n\r\nBy 1793, the [[Execution of Louis XVI|execution of the French king]] and the onset of [[Reign of Terror|the Terror]] disillusioned the \"Bildungsb\u00FCrgertum\" (educated middle classes).

The chaos and barriers in a land divided and subdivided among many different petty principalities gave way to a rational, simplified, centralized system controlled by Paris and run by Napoleon's relatives. The most important impact came from the abolition of all feudal privileges and historic taxes, the introduction of legal reforms of the Napoleonic Code, and the reorganization of the judicial and local administrative systems. The economic integration of the Rhineland with France increased prosperity, especially in industrial production, while business accelerated with the new efficiency and lowered trade barriers. The Jews were liberated from the ghetto. One sour point was the hostility of the French officials toward the Roman Catholic Church, the choice of most of the residents.

This resulted in the Swiss regaining control of Lucerne, however due to the sheer greatness in size of the French army, Von Reding's movement was eventually suppressed.

Danes were aware of French ideas and agreed with them, as it moved from Danish absolutism to a liberal constitutional system between 1750\u20131850. The change of government in 1784 was caused by a power vacuum created when King Christian VII took ill, and power shifted to the crown prince (who later became King Frederik VI) and reform-oriented landowners. In contrast to Old Regime France, agricultural reform was intensified in Denmark, serfdom was abolished and civil rights were extended to the peasants, the finances of the Danish state were healthy, and there were no external or internal crises.  That is, reform was gradual and the regime itself carried out agrarian reforms that had the effect of weakening absolutism by creating a class of independent peasant freeholders. Much of the initiative came from well-organized liberals who directed political change in the first half of the 19th century.<ref>Henrik Horstboll, and Uffe Osterg\u00E5rd, \"Reform and Revolution: The French Revolution and the Case of Denmark,\" ''Scandinavian Journal of History'' (1990) 15#3 pp 155\u201379<!--publisher, pages, ISSN\/ISBN needed--><\/ref><ref>H.

In terms of Napoleon's invasion in 1798, the response by Ottoman officials was highly negative. They warned that traditional religion would be overthrown. Long-standing Ottoman friendship with France ended. Sultan [[Selim III]] immediately realized how far behind his empire was, and started to modernize both his army and his governmental system. In Egypt itself, the ruling elite of [[Mamluk#Egypt|Mamluks]] was permanently displaced, speeding the reforms.  In intellectual terms, the immediate impact of the French Revolutionary ideas was nearly invisible, but there was a long-range influence on liberal ideas and the ideal of legal equality, as well as the notion of opposition to a tyrannical government. In this regard, the French Revolution brought such influential themes as constitutionalism, parliamentarianism, individual liberty, legal equality, and the sense of ethnic nationalism.

This usage passed to Latin America and animated the independence movement against Spain. In the nineteenth century \"Liberalism\" was the dominant element in Latin American political thought. French liberal ideas were especially influential in Mexico, particularly as seen through the writings of [[Alexis de Tocqueville]], [[Benjamin Constant]] and [[\u00C9douard Ren\u00E9 de Laboulaye]]. The Latin American political culture oscillated between two opposite poles: the ''traditional'', as based on highly specific personal and family ties to kin groups, communities, and religious identity; and the ''modern'', based on impersonal ideals of individualism, equality, legal rights, and secularism or anti-clericalism. The French Revolutionary model was the basis for the modern viewpoint, as explicated in Mexico in the writings of [[Jos\u00E9 Mar\u00EDa Luis Mora]] (1794\u20131850).\r\n\r\nIn Mexico, modern liberalism was best expressed in the [[Liberal Party (Mexico)|Liberal Party]], the [[Federal Constitution of the United Mexican States of 1857|Constitution of 1857]], the policies of [[Benito Ju\u00E1rez]], and finally by [[Francisco I. Madero]]'s democratic movement leading to the Revolution of 1911.<ref>Charles A.
