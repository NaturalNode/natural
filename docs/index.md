# Introduction

"Natural" is a general natural language facility for nodejs. Tokenizing,
stemming, classification, phonetics, tf-idf, WordNet, string similarity,
and some inflections are currently supported.

It's still in the early stages, so we're very interested in bug reports,
contributions and the like.

Note that many algorithms from Rob Ellis's [node-nltools](https://github.com/NaturalNode/node-nltools) are
being merged into this project and will be maintained from here onward.

While most of the algorithms are English-specific, contributors have implemented support for other languages. Thanks to Polyakov Vladimir, Russian stemming has been added! Thanks to David Przybilla, Spanish stemming has been added! Thanks to [even more contributors](https://github.com/NaturalNode/natural/graphs/contributors), stemming and tokenizing in more languages have been added.

Aside from this README, the only documentation is [this DZone article](https://dzone.com/articles/using-natural-nlp-module), [this course on Egghead.io](https://egghead.io/courses/natural-language-processing-in-javascript-with-natural), and [here on my blog](http://www.chrisumbel.com/article/node_js_natural_language_porter_stemmer_lancaster_bayes_naive_metaphone_soundex). The README is up to date, the other sources are somewhat outdated.
